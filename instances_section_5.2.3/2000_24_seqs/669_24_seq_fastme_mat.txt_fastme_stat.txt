Dataset 1
	Two tree searches are performed, with NNIs and SPRs respectively.
	The resulting tree is the best (shortest) of both.

	Tree length is 1.35331161	Before NNI:     tree length is 1.35590519
	NNI      1: new tree length is 1.35457897
	NNI      2: new tree length is 1.35388858
	NNI      3: new tree length is 1.35361172
	Performed 3 NNI(s).

	Before SPR:     tree length is 1.35590519
	SPR      1: new tree length is 1.35457897
	SPR      2: new tree length is 1.35388858
	SPR      3: new tree length is 1.35361172
	Performed 3 SPR(s).

	Explained variance : 0.99438857
