Dataset 1
	Two tree searches are performed, with NNIs and SPRs respectively.
	The resulting tree is the best (shortest) of both.

	Tree length is 1.26096883	Before NNI:     tree length is 1.26087725
	NNI      1: new tree length is 1.25969277
	NNI      2: new tree length is 1.25903125
	NNI      3: new tree length is 1.25891316
	NNI      4: new tree length is 1.25886941
	Performed 4 NNI(s).

	Before SPR:     tree length is 1.26087725
	SPR      1: new tree length is 1.25969277
	SPR      2: new tree length is 1.25903125
	SPR      3: new tree length is 1.25891316
	SPR      4: new tree length is 1.25886941
	Performed 4 SPR(s).

	Explained variance : 0.99431619
