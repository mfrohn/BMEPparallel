Dataset 1
	Two tree searches are performed, with NNIs and SPRs respectively.
	The resulting tree is the best (shortest) of both.

	Tree length is 1.30050135	Before NNI:     tree length is 1.30138767
	NNI      1: new tree length is 1.30033722
	NNI      2: new tree length is 1.29970751
	NNI      3: new tree length is 1.29952311
	Performed 3 NNI(s).

	Before SPR:     tree length is 1.30138767
	SPR      1: new tree length is 1.29969033
	SPR      2: new tree length is 1.29906838
	SPR      3: new tree length is 1.29890963
	Performed 3 SPR(s).

	Explained variance : 0.99148846
